By definition, a Science Gateway is "a community-developed set of tools, applications, and data that is integrated via a portal or a suite of applications, usually in a graphical user interface, that is further customized to meet the needs of a specific community". 

The Catania Science Gateway Framework (CSGF) is fully based on official worldwide standards and protocols, through their most common implementations. These are:
* The `JSR 168 <http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=168>`_ and `JSR 286 <http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=286>`_  standards (also known as "portlet 1.0" and "portlet 2.0" standards);

* The `OASIS <http://www.oasis-open.org/>`_ - `Security Assertion Markup Language <http://saml.xml.org/>`_ (SAML) standard and its  `Shibboleth <http://shibboleth.internet2.edu/>`_ and `SimpleSAMLphp <http://simplesamlphp.org/>`_ implementations;

* The Lightweight Direct Access Protocol, and its `OpenLDAP <http://www.openldap.org/>`_ implementation;

* The `Cryptographic Token Interface Standard <http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2133>`_ (PKCS#11) standard and its Cryptoki implementation;   

* The `Open Grid Forum <http://www.ogf.org>`_  (OGF) `Simple API for Grid Applications <http://www.ogf.org/documents/GFD.90.pdf>`_ (SAGA) standard and its `JSAGA <http://grid.in2p3.fr/jsaga/>`_ implementation.

* The `Open Grid Forum <http://www.ogf.org>`_  (OGF) `Open Cloud Computing Interface <http://occi-wg.org/>`_ (OCCI) standard and its `rOCCI <http://occi-wg.org/2012/04/02/rocci-a-ruby-occi-framework/>`_ implementation.

Science Gateways implemented with the CSGF are built on top of the `Liferay <http://www.liferay.com>`_ portal framework and some useful links about Liferay are listed here:

* `Liferay <http://www.liferay.com>`_
 
* `Liferay Documentation <http://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.0/getting-started>`_

* `Liferay Downloads <http://www.liferay.com/downloads/liferay-portal/available-releases>`_

* `Liferay Community <http://www.liferay.com/community/welcome/dashboard>`_

* `Liferay Wiki <http://www.liferay.com/community/wiki>`_

The sections linked below provide information and guidelines about how to install and configure the CSGF development environment as well as some examples of basic template portlets that can be further customised/adapted to integrate specific applications in the Science Gateway. 

In order to best profit from this training material, a basic knowledge of the Java programming language is required.
